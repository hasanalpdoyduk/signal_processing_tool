## Usage

The microphone button should be pressed to record the sound. Before and after the operations, the speaker key should be pressed to listen to the recorded sound. The graph button should be pressed to plot the audio signal before or after the operations. The scale of the graph can be changed by zooming in and zooming out. To change the frequency or amplitude of the audio signal, the required knob should be turned. When the microphone button is pressed again to record a new sound, the old recorded sound signal and the operations performed on it are deleted.
